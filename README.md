# MalScan - Volatility Plugin

`MalScan` for Volatility 2.6 aims to detect hidden and injected code, it works similar to [`malfind`](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility/wiki/Command-Reference-Mal#malfind) official plugin, but it takes advantage of ClamAV to reduce false positives.

## Installation

You can install all dependencies with [setup.sh](setup.sh):

- System: `python-dev`, `clamav`, `clamav-daemon`
